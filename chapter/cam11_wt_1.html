It is better that  build more railways will  do  more benifets to people  than roads .There could be serveral profits when people take trains than drivr vechiles and govement now is constructing many railways.
<br>There are various reasons why I figure take trains is better than  drive vechiles.Firstly,the tickets of trains is cheaper than vechile's gas which can save money and people can use it   do another leisure activities which will  significant improve people's life quality.And right now with the deveoping of technology the high speed trains can reach 300 kilometers per hour which is faster and more safety than driving cars.Another reason is that taking train  will not bring any gas out and do not pollute the environment which is match the govement's Green Walking Policy.The foggy day is more come often than before in our big cities like ShangHai,BeiJing and when you breathe the dust PM2.5 into your lung it will stay forever and  do harm to you health.
<br>In my view,govement should support railways' constucting.Railways can afford more transpot capacity than roads and the rate of accidents is smaller than car accidents which means takeing trains is safe.If goverment build more railways ,this action will produce  more job  chances,for example  the worker who build the railways,the ticket's seller,the train securty and so on.It will go down the rate of jobless.
<br>In conclusion,with more railways contructing,the people will get the convenience when they go out or have a trip,and the trafic of city will become smooth and the air go back to blue.
