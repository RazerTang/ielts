It is true that today people will throw out the waste to garbage without thinking how to reuse it.There could be serveral reasons why this is the case and i believe that goverment should take more care about recycling and make it a legal requirment.
<br>There are various reasons why many people think should reuse  rubbishes.Firstly,It is a pity that throwing the bottles,hard paper boxes,digital mechanism to the garage can,
becaulse they can be easily reprocessed  by professional companies and can reduce their cost.With the bussiness cost down,they can set up a low price which will also benefit to the customers.Another reason is that if not process with the waste like digital mechanism, they will do second pollution to he environment because they have some heavy metals which have a harm to the ground. 
<br>In my view,goverment should  do some  supports to  waste recycling .It is hard for people to send the waste to recycle places initiatively ,goverment should make  a law to force people recycle the waste to the recylce points,and also can give a reward to these people.Furthemore, goverment should build more reusing points and make things easy for 
people to recycle.
<br>In conclusion,with the recycling becomeing a legal requirement,more and more waste will seperate by people,and recycling will become a common conscious action in our society.
